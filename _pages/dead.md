# Category 1 - Exercise Precautions
## Great Dust Plains (G.D.P.) <i class="fas fa-tint-slash"></i> <i class="fas fa-smog"></i> <i class="fas fa-temperature-high"></i> <i class="fas fa-phone-slash"></i>
Exercise precautions in The Great Dust Plains due to water scarcity, poor air quality, extreme heat, and lack of infrastructure.

## New York City <i class="fas fa-cloud-showers-heavy"></i> <i class="fas fa-water"></i> <i class="fas fa-smog"></i> <i class="fas fa-bomb"></i> 
New York City has emptied out since the infrastructure damage from the storms of the 60's. Low-lying regions have been swamped and abandoned, while towers in lower Manhattan and midtown remain occupied. Exercise precautions while travelling due to storm damage, flooding, poor air quality and conflict between non-state groups. Stay in higher lying areas and enjoy best-in-class art and culture!

# Category 2 - Exercise Utmost Caution

## Disney World (Orlando) <i class="fas fa-cloud-showers-heavy"></i>  <i class="fas fa-water"></i> <i class="fas fa-spider"></i> <i class="fas fa-dog"></i>

Exercise utmost caution at Disney World (Orlando) due to extreme storms, flooding, dangerous insects and wild dogs.

# Category 3 - Do Not Travel


## South-Eastern Florida (S.E.F.) <i class="fas fa-pray"></i> <i class="fas fa-cloud-showers-heavy"></i> <i class="fas fa-water"></i> 

Ocean cultists are at large in Eastern Florida. If accosted, the U.S. government will not help you.

The insurgent cultists pray to the one-eyed God-Child of Poseidon and Christ, to the Rising Tide. In their belief system the Rising Tide will sweep over the United States, then climb up the mountains to the heavens and drown God. They are not "fun" or "cool".

The cultists engage in a variety of group sexual activities on the beaches they have claimed as their territory. Although due to rigorous testing and hygiene regimens there is a low risk of S.T.I's when participating in their orgies, the prudent traveller will nonetheless avoid them.

## The Mississippi River Delta <i class="fas fa-cloud-showers-heavy"></i> <i class="fas fa-water"></i> 

The Mississippi River Delta (MRD) is largely inundated and abandoned. While conflict is low due to emigration, the land is fast-shifting and treacherous.

If you do swing by the MRD with the family, make sure to scuba dive New Orleans!

# Category 4 - Hostile

## Private Western Texas <i class="fas fa-hat-cowboy"></i> <i class="fas fa-bomb"></i> <i class="fas fa-horse"></i> <i class="fas fa-spider"></i> <i class="fas fa-cloud-showers-heavy"></i>

Western Texas is owned by the Evangelical Petroleum Conglomerate and enforces its own laws and teachings within the boundaries of the Conglomerate. Evangelical Petroleum soldiers on iron horses roam the fast-changing lands and relish violence. 

Beyond the Private West Texas Petroleum Conglomerate combatants, the region offers additional risks to travellers. Abandoned horses are dangerous if still at high battery (lasts ~30 years). The climate is rapidly shifting to a tropical savavnnah, and the first wave of invasive species from the South include dangerous tropical insects and pests as well as sweeping blankets of ferns. Beware also intense hurricanes from the East and the flooding that they bring.

## Malibu <i class="fas fa-fire"></i> <i class="fas fa-low-vision"></i> 

The state department has little insight into or oversight over Malibu, California. The enclave has a number of automated security systems authorized to kill without human intervention, making it one of the most deadly destinations in the U.S. Plan ahead and reach out to the Malibu tourism bureau if you would like a tour. Wildfires are also a risk.
