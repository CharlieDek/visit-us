# Category 3 - Do Not Travel


## South-Eastern Florida <i class="fas fa-pray"></i> <i class="fas fa-cloud-showers-heavy"></i> <i class="fas fa-water"></i> 


Ocean cultists are at large in Eastern Florida. If accosted, the U.S. government will not help you.

The insurgent cultists pray to the one-eyed God-Child of Poseidon and Christ, to the Rising Tide. In their belief system the Rising Tide will sweep over the United States, then climb up the mountains to the heavens and drown God. They are not "fun" or "cool".

The cultists engage in a variety of group sexual activities on the beaches they have claimed as their territory. Although due to rigorous testing and hygiene regimens there is a low risk of S.T.I's when participating in their orgies, the prudent traveller will nonetheless avoid them.
